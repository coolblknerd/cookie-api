# Cookie-Finder API

An API to find the best cookies around! Honestly this is just a play API to practice integrating configurations, logging, and mongo into a database.

---

### Things to do 

- [x] Set up database configurations (mongo)
- [x] Set up configs (viper)
- [ ] Set up formatted logging (Zap)
- [ ] Write test for http request (httptest)
- [ ] Set-up JWTs for secured API

--- 

### Thoughts

- How do I want to organize how the app connects to the database?
- *Give a package everything it needs to operate on it's own.*
